( https://app.pictory.ai/plans?el=Email_Free_V3_ICP_Welcome_Chase_11_LetDown_Timer )Hi Muhammad,

I feel I've let you down by failing to inspire you to make videos; I'm sorry.

You see, it's been nearly two weeks since you signed up for Pictory, but you've not started
to make your first video yet. 😞

I want you to enjoy the same success as our other customers.

Is there anything I can do to persuade you to give us a try, please?
