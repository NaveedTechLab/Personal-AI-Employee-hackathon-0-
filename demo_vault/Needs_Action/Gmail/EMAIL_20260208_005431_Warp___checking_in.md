Hey!

 

Thanks for taking Warp ( https://www.warp.dev/ ) for a spin. We are periodically checking on how the app is working for folks and are wondering how your experience has been. Were you able to get started in the app OK? Any bugs or issues?

This is an automated email, but my team and I will respond to anything you send me.

Thank you!

 

Zach,

Founder @ Warp ( https://www.warp.dev/ )
