Hi Muhammad,

If you want to grow your organization, it's important your audience knows what you do and what you stand for.

The best way to do this is by using an explainer video.

Upgrade Your Pictory Account and Create Your Explainer Video Today ( https://app.pictory.ai/plans?el=Email_F2P_V3_ICP_UpDay3_Explain_Upgrade )

Explainer videos are short videos that tell your story and encourage people to buy into your mission.

Think of them as the video version of your 'elevator pitch'.
